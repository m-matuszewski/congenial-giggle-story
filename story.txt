Michael Matuszewski -

There once was a lonely object, all by itself on the heap. Its only friend
was a reference, but it lived on the stack. The object feels like the
reference is very controlling, but there's not much the object can do about
that. One cycle, the reference decided to give something to our object, and
set one of its fields.
